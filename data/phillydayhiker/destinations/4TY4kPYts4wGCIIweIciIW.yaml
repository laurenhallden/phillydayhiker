:slug: hawk-mountain-sanctuary
:review: "#### What's to love \nFun fact: Hawk Mountain was one of the most-requested
  additions to Philly Day Hiker. \"It's too far away,\" I'd claim, but in reality
  you _can_ make it from Philly to this raptor sanctuary near the Appalachian Trail
  in under 90 minutes.\n\n[The story behind](http://www.hawkmountain.org/who-we-are/history/page.aspx?id=387){:target=\"_blank\"}
  \"the world's first refuge for birds of prey\" is an interesting one: in 1929, Hawk
  Mountain was a spot where the locals would gather to watch birds of prey migrate
  through the area and the men would, well, shoot them for sport. And cash. Eventually,
  New York conversationist Rosalie Edge swooped in (har har) and put a stop to it
  by leasing the mountain and setting up a hawk refuge. Today, the sanctuary features
  excellent lookouts where you can spot up to 16 different kinds of raptors, including
  the Golden Eagle and the Peregrine Falcon.\n\nThe park offers some interesting hikes,
  as well, including the Skyline trail down a rock-face from the North Lookout, and
  the River of Rocks trail, which meanders over rough terrain past two boulder fields.
  You'll need to pay an admission fee of $10 to visit Hawk Mountain, but its well
  worth it for the amount of work the staff does; check out the [website](http://www.hawkmountain.org/events/events~default.aspx){:target=\"_blank\"}
  for tons of events (owl prowls??), [trail maps with pictures](http://www.hawkmountain.org/visit/hiking/pictorial-trail-guide/page.aspx?id=3786){:target=\"_blank\"},
  educational resources, photography contests, camps for kids, and more.\n\n#### Tips
  and quirks\n- The weather makes a huge difference in your enjoyment of Hawk Mountain.
  Relatively windless days—like the day I chose for my visit—produce few raptor sightings.
  Apparently, the birds need a breeze to stay airborne.\n- According to the Sanctuary
  [weather website](https://www.hawkmountain.org/visit/weather-at-hawk-mountain/page.aspx?id=1097){:target=\"_blank\"}
  (which I clearly should have checked ahead of time), \"cold fronts, which are often
  accompanied by northwesterly winds and followed by cold, fair weather, produce some
  of the best hawk flights. Visitors are encouraged to call the Info Line at 610-756-6000
  x6 after 6 pm to hear the day's hawk flight, a weather report, and a prediction
  for the next day's flight.\"\n- There is an ADA accessible path to the South Lookout.\n-
  No pets at the sanctuary, sorry!\n- If you take the River of Rocks trail, note that
  you are not actually supposed to cut through the boulder fields, like uhhhhhh I
  may have done. You'll end up having to find your own way to the trail on the other
  side.\n- The owl at the North Lookout is not real. It is stuffed. It fools everyone
  at first, though! Don’t feel bad."
